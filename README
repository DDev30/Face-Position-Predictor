# Face Position Detection

This repository contains a Python script that uses the Landing AI API to detect the face position of a person in a series of images. The face position can be left, right, or front-facing. This tool is useful for applications where understanding the orientation of a person's face in images is crucial.

## Features

- **Batch Processing**: The script processes a list of images in sequence.
- **Face Position Detection**: Determines whether the face in the image is oriented to the left, right, or directly front-facing.
- **Progress Tracking**: Displays the progress of image processing as a percentage.

## Requirements

- Python 
- Required Python packages:
  - `PIL`
  - `landingai`
  - `matplotlib`

You can install the necessary packages using pip:

```bash
pip install PIL landingai matplotlib
```

## Setup

**Image List**: The script processes a list of image paths stored in the `img` list. Modify this list to include paths to the images you want to process.

## Usage

1. Place your images in a directory and update the `img` list in the script with the paths to your images.

2. Run the script:

```bash
python facepos.py
```

3. The script will process each image and output the predicted face position along with the percentage of completion.

MAKE SURE TO REPLACE ALL '/' WITH '\' OR '\\'
## Example

```python
img = [
    "C:\path\to\your\image1.png",
    "C:\path\to\your\image2.png",
    ...
]
```

The output will look something like this:

```
Image-  C:\path\to\your\image1.png
[ClassificationPrediction(score=0.3603440523147583, label_name='Front', label_index=2)]
3.33% completed
...
```

## Notes

- The predictions provided by the script are generated by the Landing AI model and may not be 100% accurate.
- Ensure that the images you provide are clear and of good quality to achieve better prediction accuracy.
